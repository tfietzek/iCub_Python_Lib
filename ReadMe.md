This Repository contains Python methods to interact via YARP with the iCub.
It is organized in Python "libraries":

1. gazebo_world_controller.py
    - Methods to control the world port in the gazebo-simulator (e.g. import complex models)  
    
2. iCubSim_model_groups_control.py
    - Methods to control multi-mesh-models in the iCubSim-simulator  
    
3. iCubSim_model_groups_definition.py
    - Define the multi-mesh-models with the different meshes and textures  
    
4. iCubSim_world_controller.py
    - Methods to control the world port in the iCubSim-simulator (e.g. import simple objects)  
    
5. plot_image_processing.py
    - Methods to plot matrices with OpneCV or Matplotlib  
    
6. YARP_image_processing.py
    - Image processing in the YARP-Network flow, e.g. prepare numpy arrays for receiving images from the iCub  
    
7. YARP_motor_control.py
    - Prepare ports and drivers for iCub motor control  
    
8. YARP_network_control.py
    - establish YARP network connections for the iCub-eyes
